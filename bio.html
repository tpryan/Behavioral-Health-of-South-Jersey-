			<p>Prior to starting my private practice, I was an Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychology in the Department of Psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania. I received my PhD from The Union Institute &amp; University and completed my post-doctoral fellowship at the Center for Cognitive Therapy at the University of Pennsylvania. I was a protocol therapist for two NIMH-funded research studies examining the prevention of recurrence in depression with drugs, and treatments for panic disorder and I am currently a protocol therapist for NIMH funded research study examining the effectiveness of Computer Assisted Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for depression. I continue to be a consultant to the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Psychiatry for their Professionalism Program   I specialize in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders (including panic disorder, generalized anxiety, social phobia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder), bipolar disorder, relationship issues and cognitive therapy of personality disorders.  I am a member of the Credentialing Committee for Penn Behavioral Health.</p>



			<p>Time is precious. This is true in life and therapy. I want my patients to find a ways to create a more fulfilling life for themselves, and I want this to happen as soon as reasonably possible. I want to earn the confidence of my patients, but more importantly I want to show them how they can have confidence in themselves. I want therapy to be a positive learning experience for my patients. Cognitive therapy is an excellent set of methods to achieve these ends.
			</p>

			<p>I greatly enjoy my work. Being a therapist means that I experience the privilege of joining people- even if only for a brief time- on their journeys through life. This is highly rewarding.</p>

			<p>The therapeutic relationship is most successful when the therapist and individual work in concert with each other toward a specific goal.  This involves commitment on both the therapist's and patient's part.  The therapist endeavors to understand the patient's problems.  He/she is committed to listen, guide, render feedback, and above all, treat the patient with respect which allows the patient to be all he or she can be.  The patient attempts to understand the tenets of cognitive therapy and utilize the techniques to improve his/her every day life.   The patient is entrusted with the hard work of change which, although difficult, has as its reward, a greater personal understanding of self, others and the world around them.</p>

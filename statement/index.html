			<h2>Personal Statement</h2>
			<aside>
				<blockquote>I want my patients to find ways to create a more fulfilling life for themselves&hellip;</blockquote>
			</aside>
			<p>Therapy is most effective when the therapist and patient work together as a team. This means that the therapist shows a commitment to help, answers the patient's questions, gives feedback, demonstrates enthusiasm and professionalism, treats the patient with respect, and brings optimism, hope, and knowledge to every session. It also means that the patient is willing to be an active participant (for example, by doing his or her best to try the homework assignments between sessions), and understands that good therapy is not always a comfortable experience (though it is often very beneficial and rewarding).</p>



			<p>Time is precious. This is true in life and therapy. I want my patients to find ways to create a more fulfilling life for themselves, and I want this to happen as soon as reasonably possible. I want to earn the confidence of my patients, but more importantly I want to show them how they can have confidence in themselves. I want therapy to be a positive learning experience for my patients. Cognitive therapy is an excellent set of methods to achieve these ends.
			</p>

			<p>I greatly enjoy my work. Being a therapist means that I experience the privilege of joining people- even if only for a brief time- on their journeys through life. This is highly rewarding.</p>

			<aside>
				<blockquote>The hard work of change although difficult, has as its reward&hellip;</blockquote>
			</aside>	
			<p>The therapeutic relationship is most successful when the therapist and individual work in concert with each other toward a specific goal.  This involves commitment on both the therapist's and patient's part.  The therapist endeavors to understand the patient's problems.  He/she is committed to listen, guide, render feedback, and above all, treat the patient with respect which allows the patient to be all he or she can be.  The patient attempts to understand the tenets of cognitive therapy and utilize the techniques to improve his/her every day life.   The patient is entrusted with the hard work of change which, although difficult, has as its reward, a greater personal understanding of self, others and the world around them.</p>
